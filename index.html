<!-- 
Hard to implement:
1. 
2.

Known bugs:
1. More than 6 pairs to be counted, then the winning text appears before all the cards were flipped.
2. It's possible for one card to remain unflipped. 
3. The time doesn't show a whole minute (1:00, 2:00 etc.)
4. 

To do:
1. Losing picture + text.
2. Stop timer after win/lose.
3. Add reset/new game button.
4. Wrong guesses counter.
5. 4 digits on timer.

Geek out:
1 Add the ability to change the game theme (both images and card pattern).
2. Make the basic layout the “easy” level, add levels medium and hard (with
more 18 and 24 cards).

Ninja:
1. Add flipping animation effect for the card.
2. Add a high score functionality, that will save the name of the person with
the least amounts of wrong guesses.
